### Task - Prediction using Unsupervised ML
* From the given ‘Iris’ [dataset](https://bit.ly/3kXTdox), predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.

### Task - [Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm](https://github.com/ayushmi77al/TSF-TASK/blob/main/Prediction_using_Decision_Tree_Algorithm.ipynb)
* Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.
* The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to
predict the right class accordingly.
